                <p class="caption-text"> I'm a twenty-five-year old Chinese girl. My parents think that I have never fallen in love. It is not true. We never talk about relationships, because I withhold a secret.
I like girls. I am a closeted queer. As much as I want my family to know me better, the fear stops me from revealing the truth..</p>
